            Shakuntala Devi was born to a Hindu Brahmin family on November 4,1929. Her father first discovered her increadibale mental abilities while playing a game of cards with three year old Shakuntala. She beat her father bt memorising the entire deck of cards! Later on at the age of six, she performed her skills in many public places. People were in aw to see a young girl do such highly complex mental arithmetics without even going to school! Soon the world realized she was a child prodigy. Thanks to her passion to expand the human capacity she made the tern known as 'Mind Dynamics.'Her talents were so great that it earned her a place in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1982.
