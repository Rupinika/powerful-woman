            Even as an enslaved person, Phillis Wheatly Peters was one of the best-known poets in the pre-19th century in America. She was about 7 years old when she was enslaved and transported to the Boston docks. She was purchased by Susanna Wheatly. The Wheatlys did not excuse Phillis from her duties entirely, but they taught her to read and write. Soon she was on with her books. These books inspired her to write her own poems which was published in 1773. By the time Wheatly was 18 she had a total of 28 poems. She ran advertisments for subscribers in the Boston newspaper. Finnaly a wealthy countess instructed bookseller Archibald Bell to begin correspondence with Phillis for the preparation for the book. Lastly on April 1,1778 she got married to John Peters.
